## Scope of Variables

## Bitwise Operations

### Width vs. Possible Values

The number of bits used (width) determines the numbers that can be encoded: 2^n total.

- Unsigned: 0 through 2^n - 1
- 2's Complement: -2^(n-1) through 2^(n-1) - 1

### Numerical primitives

- **byte:** 8 bits, e.g. from -128 to 127
- **short:** 16 bits
- **char:** *unsigned* 16 bits
- **int:** 32 bits
- **long:** 64 bits

### Operators

For the following examples, assume a = 60, b = 13, c= -2. Their binary 2's complement representations are below.  
a = 0011 1100  
b = 0000 1101  
c = 1111 1110

| Operation |            Function             | Example                                        |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------|
|    `&`    |               AND               | `a&b` = `0000 1100 (12)`                       |
|    `\     |                `                | OR                                             | `a\|b` = `0011 1101 (61)` |
|    `^`    |               XOR               | `a^b` = `0011 0001 (49)`                       |
|    `~`    | Complement (bitwise inversion)  | `~a` = `1100 0011 (-61 in 2's complement)`     |
|   `<<`    |           Left shift            | `a << 2` = `1111 0000 (-16 in 2's complement)` |
|   `>>`    |     Arithmetic shift right      | `c >> 2` = `1111 1111 (-1)`                    |
|   `>>>`   | Logical shift right (zero-fill) | `c >>> 2` = `0111 1111 (127)`                  |

### Useful Tricks

- Note that in the following examples, x, 0, and 1 refer to a single bit, not a multi-bit integer
    - **XOR**
        - x ^ 0 = x
        - x ^ 1 = ~x
            - For a multi-bit integer n, n ^ -1 = ~n. This works because -1 in 2's complement is represented as
              11111111..., so each bit gets XOR'd with 1
        - x ^ x = 0
    - **AND**
        - x & 0 = 0
        - x & 1 = x
            - For a multi-bit integer n, n & -1 = n. This works because -1 in 2's complement is represented as
              11111111..., so each bit gets AND'd with 1
        - x & x = x
    - **OR**
        - x \| 0 = x
        - x \| 1 = 1
        - x \| x = x
- Swapping two values without a temporary variable
  ```
  // E.g. a = 2 (0b0010), b = 5 (0b0101)
  a = a ^ b    // a = 7 (0b0111)
  b = a ^ b    // b = 2 (0b0010)
  a = a ^ b    // a = 5 (0b0101)
  ```

## Exceptions

Three types:

1. **Checked Exceptions:** Notified by the compiler at compile-time
2. **Unchecked Exceptions:** Runtime Exceptions
3. **Errors:** Problems that arise beyond the control of the user and programmer, e.g. stack overflow

### Exception Hierarchy

![alt text](http://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Exception-in-java1.png "Java Exceptions Hierarchy")

![alt text](http://www.benchresources.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exception-hierarchy-in-java.png "Java Exceptions Hierarchy")

### try-with-resources

Automatically closes the resources used, e.g.

```java
try(FileReader fr=new FileReader(filepath)){
        // use the resource
        }catch(){
        // handle the exception
        }
```

### User-defined Exceptions

- Must be a child of `Throwable`
- If checked exception, must extend `Exception`
- If unchecked exception, must extend `RuntimeException`

<sup><sub>[▲ TOP](#table-of-contents)</sub></sup>

## Polymorphism

- Any object that can pass an IS-A test is polymorphic
    - All objects are polymorphic to the `Object` class
- Objects can **only** be accessed through reference variables
    - A reference variable can only be of one type, and that type cannot be changed once declared. However, the
      reference variable can be reassigned to other objects (given that it is not `final`)
        - The type of a reference variable determines the methods it can invoke on an object
        - A reference variable can refer to any object of its declared type or any subtype
        - A reference variable can be declared as a class or interface type

Example:
Given the following:

```java
public interface Vegetarian { ...
}

public class Animal { ...
}

public class Deer extends Animal implements Vegetarian { ...
}
```

then a Deer IS-A Animal, Vegetarian, Deer, and Object

Thus the following are all legal:

```java
Deer d=new Deer();
        Animal a=d;
        Vegetarian v=d;
        Object o=d;
```

All four of these references refer to the same Deer object on the heap.

### Static Polymorphism

*Static Polymorphism* is polymorphism that is resolved at compile time. Method *overloading* is an example of static
polymorphism.

For example, say we have the following code:

```java
int add(int a,int b){
        return a+b;
        }

        int add(int a,int b,int c){
        return a+b+c;
        }

        ...

        int x=add(1,2);    // Calls the first add method. x = 3
        int y=add(1,2,3); // Calls the second add method. y = 6
```

When we make a call to the `add` function, we can tell which function will be called before even running our code, based
on the type and number of our arguments. And, in fact, the compiler does just this -- it resolves which method will be
called at compile time, rather than waiting until runtime.

### Dynamic Polymorphism

*Dynamic Polymorphism* is polymorphism that is resolved at runtime. Method *overriding* is an example of dynamic
polymorphism.

For example, consider the following code:

```java
class Parent {
    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.printline("I am the parent");
    }
}

public class Child extends Parent {
    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.printline("I am the child");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent p = new Child();
        Child c = new Child();
        p.myMethod(); // I am the child
        c.myMethod(); // I am the child
    }
}
```

Here, we instantiate two Child objects, one using a Parent reference `p`, and the other using a Child reference `c`.

While invoking `c.myMethod()`, the compiler sees `myMethod()` in the `Child` class at compile time, and the JVM
invokes `myMethod()` in the `Child` class at run time.

`myMethod()` on `p` is quite different because `p` is a Parent reference. When the compiler sees `p.myMethod()`, the
compiler sees the `myMethod()` method in the `Parent` class. Here, at compile time, the compiler used `myMethod()`
in `Parent` to validate this statement. At run time, however, the JVM invokes `myMethod()` in the `Child` class.

This behavior is also referred to as **virtual method invocation**, and these methods are referred to as **virtual
methods**. An overriding method is invoked at runtime, no matter the data type the reference is that was used in the
source code at compile time.

### Method Overriding

Rules for *overriding* methods (**NOT** overloading!)

- The argument list must be the same
- The return type must be the same or a subtype of the return type declared in the overriden method
- The access level cannot be more restrictive than the overidden method's
- Instance methods can only be overridden if they are inherited by the subclass
- `final` methods cannot be overriden
- A `static` method can be redeclared, but not overridden
- If a method cannot be inherited, it cannot be overriden
- Constructors cannot be overriden

---------------------------------

For more information, see [Static vs Dynamic Binding](#static-vs-dynamic-binding).

<sup><sub>[▲ TOP](#table-of-contents)</sub></sup>

## Static vs Dynamic Binding

Association of a method call to a method body is known as **binding**. There are two types of binding:

1. **Static Binding** (aka Early Binding): Binding resolved at compile time
2. **Dynamic Binding** (aka Late Binding): Binding resolved at run time

In Java, static binding is used for the binding of `static`, `private`, and `final` methods. This is because these
methods cannot be overridden, and thus calls to such methods are necessarily unambiguous. The type of the class these
methods belong to can be determined at compile time.

This is important to know, for example, in situations where you might call a `static` method via an object (all though
this is generally ill-advised), like in the example below.

```java
class Human {
    public static void walk() {
        System.out.println("Human walks");
    }
}

class Boy extends Human {
    public static void walk() {
        System.out.println("Boy walks");
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Human b = new Boy();    // Reference is type Human, object is type Boy
        Human h = new Human();  // Reference is type Human, object is type Human
        b.walk();  // Human walks
        h.walk();  // Human walks
    }
}
```

On the other hand, dynamic binding is used when the compiler is not able to resolve the binding at compile time:

```java
class Human {
    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Human walks");
    }
}

class Boy extends Human {
    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Boy walks");
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Human b = new Boy();    // Reference is type Human, object is type Boy
        Human h = new Human();  // Reference is type Human, object is type Human
        b.walk();  // Boy walks
        h.walk();  // Human walks
    }
}
```

Note that, as detailed in the [Polymorphism](#polymorphism) section, the binding of *overloaded* methods is static,
while the binding of *overridden* methods is dynamic.

## Interfaces

An interface may have abstract methods, default methods, static methods, constants, and nested types. Method bodies
exist only for default and static methods.

An interface contains behaviors that a class implements. All methods of an interface must be defined in the implementing
class, unless the class itself is abstract.

Interfaces are **similar** to classes in that:

- They can contain any number of methods
- Saved as InterfaceName.java

Interfaces are **different** from classes in that:

- Interfaces cannot be instantiated
- Interfaces don't have constructors
- All interface methods are *implicitly* abstract
- An interface cannot have instance fields; only `static final` fields (constants)
- An interface can extend multiple interfaces (classes can implement multiple interfaces - but they *cannot* extend
  multiple classes)

Interfaces and their methods are implicitly `abstract`. Their methods are implicitly `public`.

### Tagging Interfaces

The most common use of extending interfaces occurs when the parent interface doesn't have any methods.
Example:
The MouseListener interface in `java.awt.event` extends `java.util.EventListener`, which is defined as follows:

```java
package java.util;

public interface EventListener {
}
```

Thus, an interface with no methods is a **tagging interface**.  
These have two basic design purposes:

1. Creates a common parent
2. Adds a data type to a class. A class that implements a tagging interface becomes an interface type through
   polymorphism

<sup><sub>[▲ TOP](#table-of-contents)</sub></sup>

## Nested Classes

Types of nested classes:

```
                                Nested classes
                                      |
                   ___________________|__________________
                  |                                      |
            Inner classes                      Static nested classes
    ______________|_________________
   |              |                 |
 Inner      Method-local        Anonymous
classes     inner classes     inner classes
```

**Java does NOT support multiple inheritance.**  
This means a class cannot inherit multiple classes.  
However, a class **can** implement multiple interfaces.

## Java Generics

```java
public static<E> void printArray(E[]array){
        for(E element:array)
        System.out.print(element+" ");
        }
        ...
// Example usage:
        Integer[]intArr={1,2,3};
        Double[]doubleArr={1.1,2.2,3.3};

        printArray(intArr);
        printArray(doubleArr);
```

You can also bound the type of the Generic parameters, e.g.

```java
public static<T extends Comparable<T>> T max(T x,T y){...}
```

Can be applied to Generic classes as well, e.g.

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T t;
    ....
}
 ```

## Serialization

Serialization allows an object to be represented as a sequence of bytes that includes the object's data as well as info
about the object's type and the types of data stored in the object.

After a serialized object has been written to a file, it can be read from the file and deserialized to recreate the
object in memory.

For a class to be serialized, it must meet two conditions:

1. It must implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface
2. All of the fields must be serializable. If a field is not serializable, it must be marked with the `transient`
   keyword

Example of serialization:

```java
try{
        FileOutputStream fileOut=new FileOutputStream("/tmp/employee.ser");
        ObjectOutputStream out=new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut);
        out.writeObject(e); // Assume e is an Employee object
        out.close();
        fileOut.close();
        }
```

The data for object `e` is now saved in `/tmp/employee.ser`.  
Note: convention is to use `.ser` (?)

Example of deserialization:

```java
Employee e=null;
        try{
        FileInputStream fileIn=new FileInputStream("/tmp/employee.ser");
        ObjectInputStream in=new ObjectInputStream(fileIn);
        e=(Employee)in.readObject();
        in.close();
        fileIn.close();
        }
```

The return value of `readObject()` should be cast to the proper class.

## Multithreading

Lifecycle of a thread:

- **New:** a new thread begins in this state where it remains until the program starts the thread
- **Runnable:** executing its task
- **Waiting:** waiting for another thread to finish a task
- **Timed Waiting:** waiting for a certain amount of time
- **Terminated:** dead

Thread priorities range from `MIN_PRIORITY` (a constant of 1) to `MAX_PRIORITY` (a constant of 10).

There are two ways of creating a thread:

1. Implement the `Runnable` interface

- If you want a class to be executed as a thread, it must implement `Runnable`. This method takes three basic steps:
    1. Implement a `run()` method
    2. Instantiate a `Thread` object, like so: `Thread (Runnable threadObj, String threadName)`, where threadObj is an
       instance of a class that implements `Runnable`, and threadName is the name given to the new thread
    3. Start a Thread object with `start()`, which executes a class to the class's `run()` method

2. Extend the `Thread` class

- This approach provides more flexibility in handling multiple threads created using available methods in the `Thread`
  class.
    1. Override the `run()` method in `Thread` class
    2. After creating the `Thread` object, start it with the `start()` method

### Thread Synchronization

What if two threads try to access the same resources? For example, if multiple threads try to write to the same file at
the same time, they could corrupt the file.

**Monitors** allow us to make sure only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. Each object in Java has a
monitor associated with it, which a thread can lock or unlock. Only one thread at a time may hold a lock on a monitor.

Use a `synchronized` block to contain shared data.

### Inter-thread Communication

Threads can be built to exchange information using three simple methods:

1. `public void wait()` -- causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes `notify()`
2. `public void notify()` -- wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the object's monitor
3. `public void notifyAll()` -- wakes up all threads that called `wait()` on the same object

All three methods can **only** be called from within a `synchronized` context.

#### Thread Deadlock

Situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. Occurs when multiple threads need the
same locks, but obtain them in a different order. Obviously, we want to **avoid this!**

## Java Collections Framework

### Overview

![alt text](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/java-collection.jpg "Java Collections Framework")

### Maps

There are four commonly used map implementations in Java: HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, and Hashtable.

![alt text](https://www.programcreek.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/MapClassHierarchy-600x354.jpg "Map Overview")

To summarize them:

- **HashMap** makes no guarantees on the ordering of keys or values.
- **TreeMap** will iterate according to the "natural ordering" of the keys according to their `compareTo()` method (or
  an externally supplied `Comparator`). Additionally, it implements the `SortedMap` interface, which contains methods
  that depend on this sort order. It is implemented via a red-black tree.
- **LinkedHashMap** is a subclass of HashMap with a linked-list implementation. It will iterate in the order in which
  the entries were put into the map.
- **Hashtable** is an obsolete class from the days of Java 1.1 before the collections framework existed. It should not
  be used anymore, because its API is cluttered with obsolete methods that duplicate functionality, and its methods are
  synchronized (which can decrease performance and is generally useless). Furthermore, in a `Hashtable`, neither the key
  nor value can be `null`. This is not the case with `HashMap`, which may have a single `null` key and multiple `null`
  values.
    - Use [ConcurrentHashMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html)
      instead of `Hashtable` when synchronization is needed.

The figure below summaries many of these differences.

### ArrayList vs. Vector

1. **Synchronization:** `Vector` is **synchronized**, which means only one thread can access it at a time,
   while `ArrayList` is not synchronized, which means multiple threads could read it at the same time.
2. **Performance:** `ArrayList` is faster, as `Vector` incurs slight overhead in acquiring the lock.
3. **Growth:** `Vector` and `ArrayList` both grow and shrink dynamically, but `ArrayList` increments **50%** of the
   current array size if the number of elements exceeds its capacity, while `Vector` increments **100%**.
4. **Traversal:** `Vector` can use both `Enumeration` and `Iterator` for traversing elements, while `ArrayList` can only
   use `Iterator`.

Generally, you'll want to use an `ArrayList`; in the single-threaded case it's a better choice, and in the
multi-threaded case, you get better control over locking. Want to allow concurrent reads? Fine. Want to perform one
synchronization for a batch of ten writes? Also fine. It does require a little more care on your end, but it's likely
what you want. Also note that if you have an `ArrayList`, you can use
the [`Collections.synchronizedList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#synchronizedList-java.util.List-)
function to create a synchronized list, thus getting you the equivalent of a `Vector`.

## Common Design Patterns

### Singleton Class

Controls object creation, limiting # of objects to only one. Since there is only one instance, instance fields will
occur once per class, similar to static fields.  
Singletons often control access to resources like database connections or sockets.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton singleton = new Singleton();

    private Singleton() {
    } // private constructor prevents any other class from instantiating

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return singleton;
    }

    protected static void demoMethod() {
        System.out.println("demo");
    }
}
```

Example usage:

```java
Singleton tmp=Singleton.getInstance();
        tmp.demoMethod();
```

Some useful posts on the variations of the Singleton pattern in Java:

## `Number` Wrapper Classes

```
                   Number
                     |
  ___________________|_________________
 |       |       |       |      |      |
Byte  Integer  Double  Short  Float  Long
```

Converting primitive data types into objects is called **boxing**.  
Similarly, the reverse operation is called **unboxing**.

## Cloning Arrays

Two methods of copying an array are using `System.arraycopy()` and `clone()`.  
An example of `System.arraycopy()`:

```java
int[]dest=new int[orig.length];
        System.arraycopy(orig,0,dest,0,orig.length);
```

An example of `clone()`:

```java
int[]dest=orig.clone();
```

Long story short, it seems the first method may be quicker on shorter arrays, but on larger datasets they have similar
performance. Furthermore, `clone()` is much more compact and easy to read. Thus, tend to prefer `clone()`.

## Other Useful Keywords

### `final` Keyword

Can be applied to variables, methods, and classes.

#### Variables

- Can be initialized only once
- A reference variable declared `final` can never be reassigned to refer to a different object. However, the data within
  the object can be changed (unless it is also `final`). In other words, the state of the object can be changed, but not
  the reference.

#### Methods

- Cannot be overriden by subclasses

#### Classes

- Cannot be subclassed. Thus, no features can be inherited.

### `abstract` Keyword

Can be applied to both methods and classes.

#### Methods

- Have no implementation. Implementation is provided by subclass.
- Can never be `final` or `strict`
- Any class that extends an `abstract` class must implement **all** of its `abstract` methods, unless the subclass is
  also `abstract`

#### Classes

- Can never be instantiated
- Cannot be both `abstract` and `final` (there is an obvious conflict of purpose between those two keywords)
- If a class contains `abstract` methods, the class **must** be declared as `abstract`
- An `abstract` class may have `abstract` as well as other methods
- An `abstract` class doesn't have to have `abstract` methods.

### `synchronized` Keyword

Indicates a block of code that can only be executed by one thread at a time. Can be applied to methods or independent
blocks.

A synchronized block can specify an object to use as a lock. This object is referred to as a "monitor" object.

See [this post](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/synchronized.html) or
the [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/eKWjfZ-TUdo) for more information.

### `transient` Keyword

An instance variable marked as `transient` tells the JVM to skip that variable when serializing the object containing it

### `throws` Keyword

Used to postpone the handling of a checked (compile-time) exception.
E.g.

```java
import java.io.*;

public class MyClass {
    public void deposit(double amount) throws RemoteException {
        // Method implementation ...
        throw new RemoteException();
    }
    ...
}
```

### `volatile` Keyword

Tells the JVM that a thread accessing the variable must merge its own private copy of the variable with the master copy
in memory. In technical terms, any variable marked as volatile will only ever be read from & written to main memory,
bypassing any CPU caching.

If a variable is not declared `volatile`, we have no guarantee about when exactly the master copy will be accessed or
modified. This can subtly cause problems in multithreaded applications that may be difficult to debug.

`volatile` can only be used on instance variables.
